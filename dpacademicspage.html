	ACADEMICS
	</div>
	<div class="infomore">
	<u>Class Structure</u><br>
Students in each year are normally divided into 4 class sections labelled A through D. A class teacher is attached to each section and remains with it for at least one academic session. There are 3 opportunities for class teachers to meet with their students on a weekly basis.

a. Daily (Monday – Friday), during morning registration.

b. Weekly Examen, Guidance session.

c. Weekly, during Personal and Social Education (PSE).

Class teachers are responsible for the pastoral care of all the students in their class and try as much as possible to get a true portrait of each student so as to enable them make useful reports (feedback) to the principal and their parents. They constantly monitor the behaviour and work of each student and try to see that their classes obey the rules and regimen of the college. The class teachers are the school’s first line of support in the pastoral and personal care of each child. Parents/Guardians are encouraged to maintain regular communication with their ward’s class teacher. The class teachers are also an extension of the counseling department.

<u>Academic Structure</u><br>
Subject teachers are divided into faculties, each run by a head of faculty. Faculties are divided into departments to encourage team-teaching, collaboration, peer-to-peer monitoring and mentorship. The Heads of Faculties (HOFs) and Heads of Departments (HODs) organise regular departmental and faculty meetings and also meet with the Vice Principal Academics as a group and on an individual basis. 
<br>

ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME (OR ACADEMIC PROBATION)<br>
This a programme geared towards getting our weak students to work at an acceptable pace,through a close supervision of their studies, monitoring of their study habits and teaching them study skills. A student is placed on academic assistance when he/she scores below our least acceptable average grade of 65% in any of our continuous assessment tests or exams.
The student on Academic Assistance does not take part in the following extra-curricular activities: clubs, choir, altar servers, athletic teams, weekend videos, and visiting with friend’s family on visiting days. The student on Academic Assistance will spend those extra-curricular activities in study hall under close supervision that ensures progress in those subjects and areas where the student has difficulties or performs poorly.
Class teachers and counsellors are to supervise their students on Academic Assistance. Every two weeks, these teachers are to give the principal a brief report on the academic progress of the students. Where necessary, subject teachers may also be asked to write a report on a student on Academic Assistance. The student will remain on Academic Assistance until the next academic assessment, after the grades for that assessment are published.
The student will go off Academic Assistance when there is a remarkable improvement in grades, through sustained improvement in studies generally, and earnest academic purpose displayed by the student in question.
Jesuit Memorial College does not want students to be on Academic Assistance, and therefore calls on other students to assist those on Academic Assistance to come off assistance as soon as possible. Academic improvement is our goal for all students, and we pray that this negative motivation will help those on probation.

GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS<br>
Only the JMC students who have successfully completed all the required course work, the three weeks of community or service project, the Citizenship and Leadership Training programme, the Kairos retreat, and are found to be worthy in character and learning will be eligible to graduate from the college. Excellence in academic work in JMC is measured by the students obtaining the least acceptable grade of 65% average in all the courses offered. Students who do not meet this minimum standard are placed on Accelerated Academic Assistance programme until they do so.

A student is considered a JMC graduate when he/she receives a JMC diploma. The diploma is an official document from the school which indicates the student’s successful completion of JMC’s required course of study. SS 3 students are eligible for graduation if and only if they have

Completed all the Continuous assessment tests and the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) and the NECO-SSCE
Are in good discipline standing with the Prefect of Discipline and the Vice-principal(Student’s life)
In addition to the above criteria of excellence in academics and in character, in order to graduate and receive a Jesuit Memorial College diploma, all graduating students are required to participate in the graduation retreat, baccalaureate mass and the graduation ceremony. The JMC’s Graduation Exercises or Graduation Ceremony is the most important event of the school year. This ceremony is a celebration of JMC’s mission and values and the students who have embraced those values over the course of their JMC career. While the diploma connotes the student’s completion of a course of study, the graduation exercises celebrate the fact that this student has come to embody the Profile of the Graduate at Graduation. As a result, participation in the graduation exercises is considered a special privilege reserved for those students whose standing with the school merits public acknowledgement and celebration.
