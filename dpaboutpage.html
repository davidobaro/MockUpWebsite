	<u>HOPE REBORN: A BRIEF HIST ORY OF THE JESUIT MEMORIAL COLLEGE</u> 
Jesuit Memorial College (JMC), 
aptly articulated in the metaphor of the Phoenix, 
the symbol of the school and expressed in its motto,
 “Hope  Reborn,” is a full boarding co-educational school, 
 rising out of the ashes of the tragic Sosoliso plane crash of 10th December 2005.
  Among the passengers on that flight were sixty-one students from Loyola Jesuit College, 
  Abuja. Sixty of them passed on tragically that day. This was a tragedy of epic proportion. 
  Fifty-four families lost their children; one family lost three children, 
  while seven families lost two children each.
   As a way of sharing/assuaging our pain and to immortalize our “Sixty Angels,” 
   the then Executive Governor of Rivers State, Chief (Dr) Peter Odili,
    graciously acquiesced to the request of the Port Harcourt parents to give seed
	 money and land to the Jesuits to begin a new Jesuit secondary school in Port Harcourt 
	 so that out of the ashes of their children, new shoots might blossom. The Jesuits of the 
	 North-West African Province of the Society of Jesus frontally and bravely took on this challenge!
	  The first phase of the project has been completed on the section of the twenty-one hectares of land 
	  provided by the Greater Port Harcourt City Development and approved by the former Executive Governor
	   of River State, Honourable Chief Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi. The pioneer class was admitted in October 2013.
	    As part of the world-wide Jesuit network of schools, the JMC aims not only at providing
		 quality education to talented young boys and girls of differing religious persuasions,
		  but also aims to set an enviable standard of academic excellence in Nigeria and in Africa. 
		  The vision is to build a centre of excellence where the panoply of educational services is designed 
		  to encourage intellectual creativity and promote character. The vision is rooted in the spirit and
		   method of the Ignatian Pedagogy which embodies the principles of order, sequence, individualization
		    and personalization of instruction – alum norum cura personalis. At the completion of six years of
			 formation and training, our students are expected to be young men and women who are conscientious,
			  persons of interior life who diligently search for meaning and the transcendence; who are competent,
			   towards a new understanding of learning as key to human development; constantly acting as a way of service to 
			   God and others – a current understanding of domestic life and ecological commitment and action.
			    The idea is not simply to immortalize our “Sixty Angels” in marble and granite, but to honour them in
				 the living memorial of other children who will live out the vision/mission embodied by them. 
				 This, no doubt, will provide an on-going healing for the bereaved families. The central focus of 
				 JMC is the memorial monument to the Sixty Angels who died in that infamous 
				 Sosoliso plane crash of 10th December 2005. The school will exist to keep their spirits alive and t
				 o allow them to reach out and touch generations of people yet unborn. The school is open to children 
				 from across the country, and will admit children of all faiths, including Muslim children. The call is to realize 
				 that these children did not die in vain. Graduates of this college, having been transformed, will in turn become 
				 agents of transformation in all Nigeria and Africa so that a better world will be born. Then truly hope will be reborn
